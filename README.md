For example: If my college student id is B422056 and my name Soubhik Kumar Gon, I need to add a file with:

```
/*
Name: Soubhik Gon
ID  : B422056
This Code Prints Hello World in Go :D
*/

package main

import "fmt"

func printText() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World ;) ");
}

func main() {
    for i:=0;i<69;i++ {
      printText();
    }
}

```
